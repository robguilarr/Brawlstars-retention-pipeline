# Pipeline - Events Activity Segmentation

> *Note:* This is a `README.md` boilerplate generated using `Kedro 0.18.4`.

# Overview

The pipeline has three nodes: `battlelogs_deconstructor`, `activity_transformer` and 
`ratio_register`.

The first node, `battlelogs_deconstructor`, receives a filtered DataFrame containing 
relevant cohorts and features, and groups the data by different types of events 
based on user-defined parameters. It returns four different DataFrames, one for each 
event type.

The second node, `activity_transformer`, receives one of the DataFrames generated by 
the previous node and aggregates the user activity data to get daily sessions. It 
then converts the cohort frequency based on user-defined parameters and returns a 
DataFrame with retention metrics and the number of sessions at the player level of 
granularity.

The third node, `ratio_register`, receives the DataFrame from the previous node and 
computes different ratios based on user-defined parameters.
